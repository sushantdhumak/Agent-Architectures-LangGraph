### Basic Reflection (reflection_agent.py)

This simple example composes two LLM calls: a generator and a reflector. 

The generator tries to respond directly to the user's requests. 

The reflector is prompted to role play as a teacher and offer constructive criticism for the initial response.

The loop proceeds a fixed number of times, and the final generated output is returned.
